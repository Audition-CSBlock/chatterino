# Chatterino

Please note that chatterino is being rewritten in c++, see the new codebase here [https://github.com/fourtf/chatterino2](https://github.com/fourtf/chatterino2)

Chatterino is a chat client for https://twitch.tv. it is still work-in-progress but there is a public windows build available here: https://fourtf.com/chatterino/

The mobile versions are currently broken and it's probably best to just unload the projects in Visual Studio.
