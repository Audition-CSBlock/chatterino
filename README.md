# Chatterino

This is an early build of my twitch chat client. Some key features are missing and will be added later, those include:

- sending messages
- clickable links
- selecting text
- correct gif emote animation speed
- oauth login dialog

For now you will have to make a file called "login.ini" containing your twitch username and oauth passcode:

    username=<your username>
    oauth=<your oauth key>

Since there are no controls for it yet, use: `CTRL + T` to create a new split, `CTRL + W` to close the selected split and `CTRL + R` to change the current selected split's channel.
